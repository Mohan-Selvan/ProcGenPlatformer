# ProcGenPlatformer
 
This repository contains the source code and assets for a grid based 2D platformer game.

## Overview
- This game was used to evaluate the procedural level generator built using a machine learning model (RL model) which resides in a different repository.
- This game includes functionality to deserialize and load the levels exported by the level generator.
- All levels generated by the generator were loaded and evaluated for human feedback and play testing.

Following image shows a snapshot of the game during game play.
